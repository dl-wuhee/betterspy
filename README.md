BibTeX files are typically manually maintained and thus often contain
inconsistencies, mistakes, or are missing information. BetterBib helps
maintaining your BibTeX files by comparing them with online sources and
correcting whatever entries are found faulty. For example, with
```
$ betterbib in.bib out.bib
```
the input BibTex
```
@article {krylov,
  author = {Liesen and Gaul and Nabben},
  title = {Deflation Krylov Augmented}
}
```
is converted into
```
@article{krylov,
  author = {Gaul, André and Gutknecht, Martin H. and Liesen, Jörg and Nabben, Reinhard},
  publisher = {Society for Industrial & Applied Mathematics (SIAM)},
  doi = {10.1137/110820713},
  title = {A Framework for Deflated and Augmented Krylov Subspace Methods},
  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/110820713},
  journal = {SIAM. J. Matrix Anal. & Appl.},
  number = {2},
  month = apr,
  volume = {34},
  source = {CrossRef},
  year = {2013},
  pages = {495-518}
}
```

At the moment, BetterBib can fetch from one of two data sources:

 * [CrossRef](http://www.crossref.org/) and
 * [MRef](http://www.ams.org/mref).

The default is CrossRef-only, but you can poke add sources as you like:
```
$ bibtex in.bib out.bib --sources mref crossref
```
This will first check on MRef and if it didn't find anything, it will check
CrossRef. All BetterBib command-line options are explained in `betterbib -h`.
